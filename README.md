Eclipse Git Plugin
==================

EGit is an Eclipse plugin for working with Git repositories. It is based
on the JGit library, which is a Git implementation in pure Java.

This package is licensed under the EPL. Please refer to the LICENSE file
for the complete license.

This package is composed of the following major components:

- org.eclipse.egit.core

    An Eclipse plugin providing an interface to org.eclipse.jgit
    and support routines to allow processing against the Eclipse
    workspace and resource APIs, rather than the standard Java
    file APIs. It also supplies the team provider implementation.

- org.eclipse.egit.ui

    An Eclipse plugin providing the user interface on top of
    org.eclipse.egit.core.

- org.eclipse.egit.core.test

    Unit tests for org.eclipse.egit.core.

- org.eclipse.egit.ui.test

    UI tests for org.eclipse.egit.ui.

- org.eclipse.egit

    A plugin for packaging

- org.eclipse.egit-feature

    Also packaging. This project is for building an Eclipse "feature"
    out of the plugins above.

- org.eclipse.egit.repository

    This package is for producing a p2 repository, i.e. a web site
    you can point your eclipse at and just upgrade.

There are other components which provide integration with other plugins.

Warnings/Caveats
----------------

- Symbolic links are supported on Java 7 and higher and require that the
  optional JGit Java 7 feature is installed. For remaining issues
  with symbolic link support see
  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=429304.

- CRLF conversion works for some things, but is in general still being
  worked on.

Compatibility
-------------

- In general, EGit supports at least the latest two Eclipse releases.
  For details, please see https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/FAQ

- Newer version of EGit may implement new functionality, remove
  existing functions and change others without other notice than what
  is written in the commit log and source files themselves.
